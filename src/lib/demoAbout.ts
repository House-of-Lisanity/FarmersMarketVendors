    content: `Hi! I’m Ava, the hands behind Maybe She Can Bake. What started as weekend experiments in my tiny kitchen turned into a passion for creating joy through baked goods. From flaky croissants to playful cookie boxes, every treat I make is handcrafted with care, quality ingredients, and a sprinkle of whimsy.\n\nI specialize in small-batch, seasonal bakes — perfect for farmers markets, custom events, or those days when you just need something sweet. Supporting local is at the heart of everything I do, and I’m proud to bring a little comfort and creativity to our community one bake at a time.\n\nWhen I’m not in the kitchen, you can find me scouting vintage bakeware, chasing after my dog Basil, or dreaming up new flavor combos that push beyond the basics.`,
